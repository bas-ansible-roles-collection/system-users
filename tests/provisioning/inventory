# This is an Ansible inventory file. It inherits from /etc/ansible/hosts if it exists
# It organises hosts/nodes into logical groups which can then be used in playbooks

# This inventory is for the all environments

# It is best practice to group hosts by location and purpose like so:

[local]
localhost

[vagrant-test]
barc-system-users-test-bare.v.m

[vagrant:children]
vagrant-test

[all-servers:children]
vagrant


[barc-system-users-test-nodes-local]
barc-system-users-test-bare.v.m

[barc-apache-test-webservers:children]
barc-system-users-test-nodes-local
