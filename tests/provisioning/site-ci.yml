# Setup infrastructure for testing role

# Apply role to test VMs,
# host-vars are used to control which features of the role are applied to each VM.
# For each test a set of tasks will be run to check the selected features of roles are correctly applied.

# Note: The 'authorized_keys_files_contents' option is not supported by the system users role, it used exclusively for
# testing.

# Note: The value for the 'password' option is stored in clear text. This is acceptable for testing, but nowhere else!
